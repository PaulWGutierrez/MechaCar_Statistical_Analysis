# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict
####- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
#### The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance were ground clearance and mpg as indicated in image with 3 asterisks on the "Coefficients:" table.
### - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
#### No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the Intercept is at 17.4 and the vehicle weight is at -0.0002, as well as the p-value is 6.712e-11 which is smaller than the significance level of 0.05%.
### - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
#### This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the Multipe R-squared is 0.711 which indicates there is a correct outcome of about 71%.
